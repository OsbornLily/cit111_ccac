## About Me
   Just trying to keep my head above water in an Intro Java Programming course! Love me some Green Tea, and Baked Oats. 
   I have a Cat. He is an angry beast, and only prefers to have me hold him. Yes, that does make me a pretty big deal in the house.
   
   Wise words to end my introduction brought to you from my Sustainability Professor: "Stay healthy, eat right, exercise, wash hands, recycle, read and stay positive!"
